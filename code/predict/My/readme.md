Five - Fold Cross - Validation Algorithm for Random Forest  

This repository contains the implementation of the five - fold cross - validation algorithm for the random forest proposed in our paper. It provides both classification and regression functionalities.


Classification  
To obtain the classification results, run the following command in your terminal:

    python cls.py
This script will execute the five - fold cross - validation process using the random forest algorithm for classification tasks.  

Regression  
For regression results, execute the following command:

    python reg.py
This command will trigger the five - fold cross - validation for the random forest algorithm in regression scenarios.
